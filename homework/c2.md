# 🏠 **Class 2 Homework: Understanding Core Web Features & Improved Prompting**

## **1. Feature Awareness (User-Facing and Essential)**

Research the following for your idea. For each, find:

* **1 real-world app example** (describe briefly or link a screenshot)
* **1–2 sentences** explaining why it matters for user experience

**Features:**

* **User Login/Signup:** Why do users need accounts? What does a smooth login feel like?
* **Navigation (Navbar):** How do users move around the app easily?
* **Landing Page:** What makes a welcoming first impression?
* **Responsive Design:** How does your app look on a phone vs computer?
* **Error Messages:** What happens if something goes wrong for a user?

## **2. Prompting Practice**

* Write **3 prompts** (1–2 sentences each) to add a feature to your app.
* Each prompt should be simple and clear, e.g.:

  * “Add a user login form on the home page that asks for email and password.”
  * “Create a top navigation bar with links to Home, Profile, and Logout.”
  * “Display a friendly error message if login fails.”
