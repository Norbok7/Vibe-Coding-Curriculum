# üõ†Ô∏èüöÄ Class 3 & 4 Homework: Polish, Fix, and Level Up Your MVP with Startup-Grade Features

---

### **IMPORTANT:**

**Before you start this homework, make sure every existing feature in your app is fully working and meets your original requirements. If anything is broken, incomplete, or not functioning as you want, FIX IT FIRST. Do not move forward until your current app is solid.**

---

### **Context:**

Now that your MVP is functional and every feature actually works, it‚Äôs time to research and plan the next level for your project. This homework is about discovering and proposing features that make real products competitive, scalable, and user-friendly‚Äîgoing beyond the bare minimum.

---

## **1. Research & Evaluate Startup-Grade Features**

**Pick at least 3 features from this list. For each:**

* **Find 1 user-friendly example in a real app** (describe briefly, provide a link, or include a screenshot)
* **Write 1‚Äì2 sentences** explaining why this feature adds value for users or your business.

**Feature Options:**

* **User Profiles/Settings**
* **Notifications (Email, SMS, or In-App)**
* **Search or Filtering**
* **Data Export/Import**
* **Privacy/Permissions**
* **Integrations (Connecting to other tools/APIs)**

## **2. Advanced Prompting Practice**

* For your chosen features, **write 3 clear prompts** to add them to your app.

  * Example: ‚ÄúAdd an edit profile page where users can change their display name and email.‚Äù
  * Example: ‚ÄúShow a notification on the dashboard when there‚Äôs a new message.‚Äù

---

## **3. Prepare for Class 4**

* Bring your researched examples and explanations for each feature.
* Bring your 3 advanced prompts.
* Be ready to explain *why* these features should be next for your app and how they‚Äôll improve the user experience or business case.

---

### **Why This Matters:**

You now have the basics‚Äîthis is how you turn your MVP into something real users will value, pay for, or recommend. But remember: **Don‚Äôt move forward until every current feature is working perfectly. Quality comes first.**
