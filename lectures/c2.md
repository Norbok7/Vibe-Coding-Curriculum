## üßë‚Äçüíª CLASS 2: From Vibe to Working Starter (Replit + CustomGPT)
---

### 1. **Review & Intake (10 min)**

- Instructor reviews each startup‚Äôs:

  - One-context window 300-500 characters for maximum AI reasoning idea pitch
  - Core and bonus features
  - Top color palette (screenshot or hex)
  - Top design inspiration (screenshot or link)

- **No prompts move forward without instructor sign-off.**

---

### 2. **Generating a Starter in Replit Using CustomGPT (30+ min)**

#### **Step-by-Step Workflow:**

1. **CustomGPT Initial Prompt**

   - Startups enter their approved project summary into CustomGPT.
   - Receive a technical breakdown + first Replit starter prompt draft.

2. **Insert Into Replit (Not ‚ÄúDeploy,‚Äù Just Generate)**

   - Copy/paste the CustomGPT prompt into Replit‚Äôs AI (free account; use extra emails if desired to test more designs).
   - Before accepting the initial design, **immediately enter your design theme choice** (reference screenshot, layout, or style inspiration).
   - Review the result. If not satisfied, **try your secondary or third design inspiration** for theme/layout.

3. **Apply Color Palette**

   - Once the layout/structure matches your vision, prompt Replit to apply your chosen color scheme.
   - Check: Does this version feel right? Does it capture your intended vibe and function?
   - If not, iterate on the design until it does, potentially go back to customGPT for a new starter prompt.

4. **Approval Checkpoint**

   - Only move forward when your starter project checks every box for:

     - Layout
     - Theme
     - Color
     - Core features in place (even if minimal)

---

### 3. **Prompting Fundamentals Refresher (10 min)**

- **Clarity = Results:** One feature per prompt, keep it direct.
- **Complexity = Cost:** Replit charges more for complicated prompts‚Äîkeep them tight.
- **Rollback:** Don‚Äôt waste agent usage‚Äîrollback and retry instead of sending prompt after prompt.
- **Instructor must review and approve all prompts before you send them.**
- _Measure twice, cut once._ Take time to think before you ask.

---

### 4. **Wrap-up**

- End class with startups documenting their final starter: screenshots and notes.
- No one moves forward unless the foundation is solid and instructor-approved.
