# 🏗️ CLASS 3: From Blueprint to Working Product—Implement, Test, and Refine

---

## 1. **Prompt Review & Feedback** (15 min)

* Present your three prompts and real-world examples.
* Instructor/class critique for clarity, completeness, and practical value.
* **Reminder:** Prompts should result in fully working features, not half-done placeholders.

---

## 2. **Web App Architecture—Key Parts Recap** (15 min)

* **Routes:** Connect pages and features (`/login`, `/profile`, etc.).
* **Components:** Building blocks like navbars, forms, buttons.
* **Database:** Where user/app data lives.
* **Config/Theme/API Keys:** Controls look, settings, and secure service access.

## 3. **Hands-On: Implement & Validate Every Feature** (25 min)

### **A. Implement According to Your Research**

* Add each researched/prioritized feature to your project—prompt or edit directly.
* **Every feature must work** for the user. No placeholders, no “dead” UI.

### **B. Update All Instances—No Partial Fixes**

* If a feature appears more than once (e.g., two login forms, multiple profile pages), **all must be updated**.

  * **Prompt example:** “Update both login forms (homepage and modal) to require email and password and show errors for wrong info.”
  * **No skipping**: If it’s in your app, it must be functional or gone.

### **C. Remove or Fix Broken Elements**

* Audit the app: Click every button, use every form, test all routes.
* Remove or repair anything that doesn’t work or isn’t needed.

### **D. Rollback—Don’t Waste Prompts on Broken Fixes**

* **If a prompt makes things worse, or doesn’t work as expected:**

  * **ROLL BACK** immediately to the last working state.
  * Do **not** waste time trying to “troubleshoot” or stack prompts to fix the problem—rollback, rethink, and redo with a better prompt or direct edit.
* **Why?** Chaining prompts wastes time, money, and often creates more problems. Always “measure twice, cut once.”

## 4. **Prompting & Testing—Non-Negotiables** (5 min)

* **All prompts must mention every place a feature appears.**
* **Test after each change.**
* **Checklist:**

  * All features work everywhere they appear.
  * No dead buttons or forms.
  * No broken links.

---

## 5. **Class Wrap-Up & Accountability** (5 min)

* **Nothing advances unless every researched feature is present, functional, and complete.**
* **Rollback on errors, don’t band-aid broken prompts.**
* Get instructor sign-off before considering your work “done.”

**Direct, no-excuses, and no wasted time on broken features or half-fixes. Let me know if you want this in slides, handout, or checklist form.**
