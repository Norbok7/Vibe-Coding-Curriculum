# 🔄 **Class 4: Iterative Development & Real-World Debugging**

---

## 1. **Intro & Mindset Reset (5 min)**

* **Goal:** Reinforce “one task at a time” approach—don’t overload prompts.
* **Why:** Faster results, less confusion, easier debugging, lower costs.

---

## 2. **Feature Selection & Prompting (10 min)**

* Each student selects their **first major feature to add or improve**
  *(e.g., user registration, displaying dashboard data, notifications)*.
* Write a **clear, concise prompt** for just that feature.
* Instructor reviews and approves before anyone proceeds.

---

## 3. **Implementation: Agent Does the Work (10 min)**

* Paste the prompt into the AI agent (Replit or similar).
* Let the agent generate/implement the feature—*don’t intervene until it finishes*.

---

## 4. **Testing & Immediate Feedback (15 min)**

* Test the new feature in the app—right away.
* If it fails or breaks:

  * **Stop.** Don’t send random fixes.
  * **Debug Methodically:**

    * **Read the error:** What is the actual message?
    * **Gather clues:** Which line, what does it say, what was supposed to happen?
    * **Isolate the problem:** Where is it, what was the last change?
  * **Prompt again** with:

    * The error message
    * The code snippet (if possible)
    * What you want to happen
  * *Example:*
    “Fix the registration form: Error says ‘password is undefined’ in Registration.js, line 10. The password field should save user input.”

---

## 5. **Checkpoint After Each Success (5 min)**

* After a feature works as intended:

  * **SAVE A CHECKPOINT** (use Replit’s built-in feature or export a backup).
  * **Why:** If you break something next, you can always roll back. Don’t lose your working progress.

---

## 6. **Outcome & Wrap-Up**

* Students complete at least one real feature, fully tested.
* Practice the **prompt → test → debug → refine** loop.
* Next class: repeat for more features, keep building iteratively, and add polish.

---

### **Key Takeaways for Students**

* Always focus on **one feature at a time.**
* Debug with facts, not guesses.
* Save your work after each win.
