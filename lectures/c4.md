# 🔄 **Class 4: Iterative Development & Real-World Debugging**
---

## 1. **Intro & Mindset Reset (5 min)**

- **Goal:** Reinforce “one task at a time” approach—don’t overload prompts.
- **Why:** Faster results, less confusion, easier debugging, lower costs.

---

## 2. **Feature Selection & Prompting (10 min)**

- Each startup selects their **first major feature to add or improve**
  _(e.g., user registration, displaying dashboard data, notifications)_.
- Write a **clear, concise prompt** for just that feature.
- Instructor reviews and approves before anyone proceeds.

---

## 3. **Implementation: Agent Does the Work (10 min)**

- Paste the prompt into the AI agent (Replit or similar).
- Let the agent generate/implement the feature—_don’t intervene until it finishes_.

---

## 4. **Testing & Immediate Feedback (15 min)**

- Test the new feature in the app—right away.
- If it fails or breaks:

  - **Stop.** Don’t send random fixes.
  - **Debug Methodically:**

    - **Read the error:** What is the actual message?
    - **Gather clues:** Which line, what does it say, what was supposed to happen?
    - **Isolate the problem:** Where is it, what was the last change?

  - **Prompt again** with:

    - The error message
    - The code snippet (if possible)
    - What you want to happen

  - _Example:_
    “Fix the registration form: Error says ‘password is undefined’ in Registration.js, line 10. The password field should save user input.”

---

## 5. **Checkpoint After Each Success (5 min)**

- After a feature works as intended:

  - **SAVE A CHECKPOINT** (use Replit’s built-in feature or export a backup).
  - **Why:** If you break something next, you can always roll back. Don’t lose your working progress.

---

## 6. **Outcome & Wrap-Up**

- Startups complete at least one real feature, fully tested.
- Practice the **prompt → test → debug → refine** loop.
- Next class: repeat for more features, keep building iteratively, and add polish.

---

### **Key Takeaways for Startups**

- Always focus on **one feature at a time.**
- Debug with facts, not guesses.
- Save your work after each win.
