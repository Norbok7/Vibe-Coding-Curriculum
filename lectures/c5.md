# üîê **Class 5: Add Authentication, Database, and Demo Mode‚ÄîPrompt-Only (Replit v2)**
---

## **Section 1: Why This Matters**

- Investors and testers want fast, frictionless access‚Äîdemo mode gets you in the door.
- Real users need secure accounts‚ÄîReplit Auth is quick and reliable.
- Data should be user-specific and private‚Äîtie it to the Replit database, not local variables.

---

## **Section 2: Live in Class‚ÄîPrompt-Driven Build**

### **A. Add Authentication with Replit**

**Prompt 1:**

> ‚ÄúAdd authentication to my app using Replit v2 Auth.
>
> - Users should be able to log in and log out using the Replit system.
> - Display ‚ÄòLogin with Replit‚Äô and ‚ÄòLogout‚Äô buttons in the navbar.
> - When logged in, show the user‚Äôs name in the header.‚Äù

---

### **B. Integrate with Replit Database**

**Prompt 2:**

> ‚ÄúWhenever a user logs in, save their user ID, name, and email to the Replit database.
>
> - Store under the key user:\[userID].
> - On app load, retrieve user data from the database and use it to personalize the UI.
> - If no user is logged in, show a generic welcome message.‚Äù

---

### **C. Add a Demo Mode for Instant Testing**

**Prompt 3:**

> ‚ÄúAdd a ‚ÄòDemo Mode‚Äô button on the login page and navbar.
>
> - When clicked, simulate a user with the name ‚ÄòDemo User‚Äô and a generic email, without requiring authentication.
> - In demo mode, allow full navigation and interaction, but do not save any permanent data to the database.
> - Display a clear ‚ÄòDemo Mode‚Äô banner or label at the top of every page when active.‚Äù

---

### **D. Ensure Separation Between Real Users and Demo Users**

**Prompt 4:**

> ‚ÄúMake sure the app clearly separates demo mode and real user sessions:
>
> - Never save or overwrite real user data when in demo mode.
> - Always display a warning if demo mode is active.
> - Make it easy to switch between demo mode and normal login.‚Äù

---

### **E. Test All Flows and Remove Redundant Steps**

**Prompt 5:**

> ‚ÄúTest the app to ensure:
>
> - Real user login and logout works, data is saved and loaded per user.
> - Demo mode works instantly, no authentication needed, no real data saved.
> - Both login and demo mode buttons are visible and work as described.
> - All login/logout/demo transitions are smooth and bug-free.
> - Remove any unused or redundant login forms, pages, or buttons.‚Äù

## **Section 3: Quick Startup Checklist**

- Copy and run each prompt above in your Replit v2 app‚Äî**no manual code editing needed**.
- After each step, test the functionality.
- If a feature is broken, **rollback to the last working version, then re-prompt with more detail or error info**.

---

## **Section 4: Best Practices for Demos & Investors**

- **Demo mode** is for instant access, not long-term accounts‚Äînever let demo data persist.
- Make demo mode easy to find and visually obvious.
- Always test both real login and demo before presenting your app.
